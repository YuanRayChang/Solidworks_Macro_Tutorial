# Solidworks Macro Tutorial
In this tutorial, I will show the process of how to make an .exe file using VB.net.

Because there is little information on the internet. So I decided to write one.

Many other tutorials have tought the way to record a macro, and run the macro on Solidworks. However, this is not enough.

Someone like me want to use an .exe file, so that I can call the macro directly by command window, instead of Solidworks.

### Software I used:
* Solidworks 2017
* Visual Studio 2013
I think it's not necessary to use the exact same version.

### Tutorial starts by here:
The first step is click the start macro button, then you can record everything you need.
![]("image/start.PNG")

In my case, I draw a cuboid

Finally, click the stop button
![]("image/end.PNG")

After recording a macro, you should save it as 
`SW ALL Macros Types (*.swp;*.csproj;*.vbproj)`
